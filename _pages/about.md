Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [Maastricht University](http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl) the Netherlands and work in the [Department of Neurosurgery](www.mumc.nl/en) of the [School for Mental Health and Neuroscience](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/school-mental-health-and-neuroscience). 

Personal Statement 
======
Stijn Michielse started a Bachelor’s education in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, which was completed in 2006. The Bachelor of Medical Technology at Zuyd University was the succeeding step including a research visit at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada) and got attracted by the fascinating field of MRI research. Subsequently, he started working as a research assistant at the Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology in the School for Mental Health and Neuroscience at Maastricht University. The next step in 2011 was to start a Master’s program at the Research Master in Health Sciences – specialization in Clinical Epidemiology – within the School for Public Health and Primary Care. He graduated in the year 2013 and was able to directly start working as a PhD candidate in the Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Maastricht University. During the PhD trajectory Stijn was involved in several projects related to psychotic disorder and white matter imaging using Diffusion Weighted Imaging. During the PhD there was a research visit at the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom). After obtaining the PhD, Stijn continued to work in the field of MRI research and visited the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada) for a research project on the fusion of structural and functional MRI data. This was followed by a post-doctoral fellowship research project at Maastricht University. Currently he is involved in various research projects for Parkinson’s disease at Maastricht University Medical Center including ultra-high field 7T MRI imaging in patients (the TRACK-PD study) and investigating postmortem tissue of patients who passed away with PD. The latter study involves 9.4T MRI scanning and histological investigation of brain tissue.
